                        My name is Ozzie, and I've worked as welder/fabricator in Virginia and Washington for 7 years. Before that, I worked in the auto parts industry for an additional 7 years, which is what made me want to learn to weld
                        and fabricate - I wanted to be able to modify and customize cars.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I learned to weld and earned my certifications from the <a href="https://www.rvaschools.net/RATC" style="color: red;">Richmond Adult Technical Center</a>, where I learned to stick, MIG and TIG weld. My career has
                        been focused around TIG welding, primarily with aluminum but also stainless and carbon steels.
